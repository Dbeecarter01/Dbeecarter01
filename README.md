I just finished the Google Cybersecurity course and have a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in the Google Cybersecurity course has led me to develop a passion for System Administration. I am now eager to use the skills I have learned so far in this Google Cybersecurity program, specifically aiming to use my skills as an Entry-Level Information Security Analyst.
